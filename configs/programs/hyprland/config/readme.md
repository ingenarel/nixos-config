### if you're not me then it's probably best if you fork it. cz i tinker with shit and push half done commits :)
- make sure that you don't have a hypr directory in your config. and if you do, rename it to something.
- clone this bitch to the config directory. 

- swaync for notif
- waybar for bar
- cliphist for clipboard
- yazi for file manager
- kitty for terminal
- wofi for menus
- grim and slurp for taking screenshots
- https://www.gnome-look.org/p/999988 this is probably the cursor that i'm using
- the sudo mountall is a mount script that i made because fstab would cause some errors if a drive wasn't mounted.
